# Beyond Hype and the Tyranny of Metrics

## The antidote to hype-driven fear? Ask critical questions:

- How does this work over time? (Maintenance, upgrades, etc.)
- How does this affect people? (Team impact, scaling, new user costs)
- What is this good for? And crucially, **What is this NOT good for?**

## The Tyranny of the Measurable:

Tech’s love affair with quantitative data can become a blind spot — the **McNamara Fallacy**.

1. Measure what’s easily measured.
2. Disregard what isn’t.
3. Presume the unmeasurable is unimportant.
4. Assume the unmeasured doesn’t exist.

This is perilous. Many important things (love, team morale, the *quality of an idea*) resist easy quantification. Qualitative methods can yield crucial insights. We must have the courage to act on things that matter, even if we can’t slap a metric on them.

## Embracing Complexity:

Organizations often crave “legibility,” a simplified, controllable view of complex systems. But software development, like a forest ecosystem, is inherently complex. Oversimplification leads to **brittle, unsustainable solutions** (like forestry monocultures). We must learn to navigate, not naively suppress, this complexity.

## The Human Element:

Ultimately, technology is a human endeavor. We are messy, feeling creatures. Recognizing our anxieties, fostering open communication…
