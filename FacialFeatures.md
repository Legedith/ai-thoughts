Subject: South Asian adult man (late 20s–mid 30s). Face shape: broad oval leaning soft-square; face is wide; jaw is wide with rounded corners (no sharp V), chin broad and rounded, cheeks moderately full (not puffy, not hollow). Skin: warm medium-brown with realistic texture, slight natural sheen on nose/forehead.
Eyes: dark brown, almond-shaped, slightly deep-set with mildly hooded upper lids; subtle natural squint (not wide-open). Eyebrows: extremely thick, dense, dark black; mostly straight; low-set over the eyes; close at the center (nearly meeting but clearly separate), not groomed/arched.
Nose: medium width, straight bridge, rounded tip; moderately wide nostrils (avoid narrow “model nose”; avoid overly wide nose). Mouth: medium lips with fuller lower lip; neutral serious expression with a very subtle tight-lipped half-smile (barely there), no big grin.
Hair: very thick dense black hair, wavy-to-curly with visible curl clumps (tighter curl than loose waves), high volume messy curls on top (not slick quiff), shorter tapered sides.
Facial hair: dense dark short boxed beard (about 8–10 mm), high natural cheek line, thick connected mustache blending into beard; clean neckline; beard dense but not oversized.
