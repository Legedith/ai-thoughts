- Generate architecure using an LLM. Pass it thorugh a mixture of experts and get them to review it. They should be able to point out flaws, and make sure that the system starts from a good plan, found this: https://gwern.net/ai-daydreaming
- can i train a model locally using my data (from emails, whatsapp, etc), just training it to talk like me, think like me. 
- can we train an agent to work by working with us, like we train someone to do something. giving the agent teh access to browser and all, but us telling it what to click and what to do. Agent can ask us questions along the way,, and then we can see the agent mimicking out actions. 
- can we extract the whatsapp chat history, put it through some analysis model, and get insights, charts, etc into a relationship?

FIgure out trends in my thining and ideologies accross time.
