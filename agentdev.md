If I dont get results in the first iterations, instead of asking for fixes, I just restart the whole atoma of work
I ask it to plan (in agent mode, not in plan mode) beforehand and encourage it to read stuff, go online and search, etc
After each task, i ask it to tell me what worked, what didnt work, what could be done next time to be clearer in intent
I prefer cmd over UIs, uv over python, cmd tools over code. This allows the agent to do lots of stuff. I encourage it to try out useful tools using uvx.
After all this, gpt-5 works better for me
Gemini is too shy. It'll do exactly what you tell it to do, even if it is wrong
Claude works better for JS and UI/UX stuff, but not for my use cases.
